# Typed React Package Starter

A template for repositories of custom React components and hooks, properly typed with Typescript, divided
into sub packages with Lerna and visually testable with Storybook. ``packages/`` includes two examples for 
subpackages that you can build upon: ``packages/component-package`` with a sample implementation of a custom 
react component, including a *spec* test-file, a storybook story and a MDX-based storybook documentation; And
``packages/hook-package`` with a sample implementation of a custom react hook, including a hook test implementation
and a storybook story.
